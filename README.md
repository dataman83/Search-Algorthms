 The problem- which is known as the “Help the Robot” problem- involves guiding a robot from a starting point to a goal point. It sounds straightforward but given the NxN can become very large means that the possible paths to the goal point keeps increasing. Moreover, the possible movements that can be made by the robot have restrictions and the robot can only make a fixed set of moves. Considering all of these, a good overview of the problem would be that robot needs to go to the goal point from the start point on a given NxN grid using an optimal path. To further simplify, the ‘’Help the Robot” is a popular search problem in which a robot must navigate from start position to goal position on a grid while avoiding obstacles. The grid is best defined as a square matrix; each cell can be empty (robot can move through it), blocked (cliffs in our case, robot cannot move through it), the start cell and the goal cell.
